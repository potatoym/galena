Galena: Genetic Algorithms breeding images.  
(Lena is a standard image for the industry)

Inspired by http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/

Ideally, CUDA+OpenGL will make this an interesting bit of code.  Started a long time ago, but never finished.  Trying again...we'll see.

======================================================================
Notes:

goal image:
  png -> png++ class -> unsigned int array -> pbo -> glDrawPixels -> framebuffer

population images
  verts -> drawArray -> framebuffer
  framebuffer - goal framebuffer -> fitnessArray
  sort fitnessArray
  breed new verts

1. Choose initial population
2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population
3. Repeat until termination: (time limit or sufficient fitness achieved)
   a. Select best-ranking individuals to reproduce
   b. Breed new generation through crossover and/or mutation
      (genetic operations) and give birth to offspring
   c. Evaluate the individual fitnesses of the offspring
   d. Replace worst ranked part of population with offspring
